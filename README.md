# Huffman Coding Application

This Java application implements Huffman coding, a popular algorithm used for lossless data compression. It allows users to encode and decode text using Huffman codes, visualize the Huffman tree, and save/load encoded data.

## Features

- **Encoding**: Enter a text string and click on the encode button to generate the corresponding Huffman encoded text.
- **Decoding**: Decode Huffman encoded text to retrieve the original message.
- **Huffman Tree Visualization**: View the Huffman tree generated during encoding.
- **Save/Load**: Save the Huffman tree and encoded text to a file, and load them for later use.

## Getting Started

To use this application, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

2. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE (e.g., NetBeans, IntelliJ IDEA).

3. Run the `Main.java` file to launch the application.

4. Enter a text string in the input field and click on the encode button to generate Huffman encoded text.

5. Explore other features such as decoding, Huffman tree visualization, and save/load functionality as needed.

## Usage

- **Encode**: Enter a text string in the input field and click on the encode button. The encoded text will be displayed in the output field.
- **Decode**: Click on the decode button to decode Huffman encoded text and view the original message.
- **Visualize Huffman Tree**: Click on the visualize button to display the Huffman tree used for encoding.
- **Save/Load**: Use the save and load buttons to save the Huffman tree and encoded text to a file, and load them for later use.
